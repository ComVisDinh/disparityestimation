#Deep Network Exploitation for Disparity Estimation Using Stereo Images with Different Focal Lengths

This study proposes a disparity estimation method for images captured by cameras with different focal lengths. Short focal length captures a close scene, whereas long focal length captures a far scene. The proposed method computes full disparity maps for both the close and far scenes. To achieve this, we introduce a stereo rectification method that works directly on images with different focal lengths and parameterizes the zoom levels between the two cameras.
